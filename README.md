# Cryptopals Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the [Matasano Crypto Challenge](http://cryptopals.com/).

__Warning__: The whole funny part of the challenge is trying to solve the sets by yourself. 
Look at the online solutions only afterwards, to evaluate yours.

## Try it out

### Requirements
This project explicitly requires a Python version â‰¥ 3.4.
I've experimented with [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
Any other requirement is listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Launch it
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aldur/MatasanoCrypto.git
$ cd MatasanoCrypto
$ python3 setup.py develop
$ python3 bin/matasano <challenge number>
```

## Read it
The `bin/matasano` file contains the code used to solve each problem.
Navigate the code from there.
